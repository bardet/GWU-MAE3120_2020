# MAE 3120, Spring 2020

To update course material locally, follow these steps:

1. <a data-auto-download href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bardet/GWU-MAE3120_2020/master/Fetch.ipynb">Download <b><i>Fetch</b></i></a>. If the download appears in a new tab, save it to your computer as a '.ipynb' file. 

2. Place ***Fetch*** into its own folder on a Jupyter server.

3. Run ***Fetch*** every time you need to update/initially download course material. *Note: all lectures will be replaced every time you run ***Fetch*** unless you change the `MIN_LECTURE` value at the top of the file.*
