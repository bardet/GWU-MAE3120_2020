    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Strain gages are some of the most frequently used resistive sensors. They feature a metal foil mounted on a thin epoxy, which serves as the support material. Because they are manufactured using the same techniques as for printed circuits, they can be made into a number of different configurations based on the needs of the experiment. These include single and multi-dimensional strain gages such as rosettes, which contain multiple elements and measure the strain at different angles. In addition, strain gages are also very light and flexible so they do not affect the performance of the system nor do they need to be mounted to a flat surface. The surface does however; need to be clean and smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle behind strain gages is very simple. As a wire changes length and cross-sectional area, the resistance in turn also changes according to the equation below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = \\frac{\\rho L}{A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $R$ is the resistance, $\\rho$ is the resistivity of the wire, $L$ its length, and $A$ its cross-sectional area. Since the strain gage is bonded to the strained member, as the member deforms so will the strain gage. This in turn produces changes to the length and cross-sectional area, which change the resistance and allow the strain to be measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "To correlate the strain of a given member to the change in resistance of the gage, there are additional dependencies on the material of the metal foil, the change in resistivity as the member strains, and Poisson's ratio, which need to be considered. If the strain remains in the elastic range, then these dependencies will remain almost constant. Manufacturer's of strain gages supply what is termed a gage factor ($S$) for each gage which is determined by the equation below for a wire with a square cross-section, where $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio, and $\\epsilon_a = \\delta L\\,/\\,L$ is the axial strain. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$S = 1 + 2 \\nu + \\frac{\\delta \\rho\\,/\\,\\rho}{\\epsilon_a} = \\frac{\\delta R\\,/\\,R}{\\epsilon_a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in the elastic regime, axial strain, $\\sigma_a$, and stress are related with Hooke’s law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_a = \\frac{F}{A} = E \\epsilon_a$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With $F$ the axial load, and $E$ the Young elastic modulus of the material under test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some properties of the strain gage used for this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $R_{nominal}$: $350\\,\\Omega$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S$: $2.105$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Material**: Constant\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure strain there are several configurations for strain gage mounting: the quarter, half, and full bridges. Quarter bridges are nonlinear with respect to strain, but with a half or full bridge, it is linear with respect to strain and the sensitivity is increased because several gages are in compression and in tension. In general, the change in resistance is very small, thus the output still needs to be amplified to obtain an easily measurable signal. For this lab we will use all three configurations and we will use weights to record the strain on a cantilever beam as shown below. \n",

    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will be broken down in 4 parts. First you will learn about the Wheatstone bridge. Then you will modify the acquisition system to read strain values like you did in the last lab for the thermistor values. Then you will build and record the values for different loads and different Wheatstone bridges. Finally, you will do some calculations to analyze the data. For this lab there are questions to be answered on your lab report for each part. Make sure you pay attention to what the procedure requires you to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part I - Wheatstone Bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/Wheatstone.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The bridge configuration is made of two voltages dividers, one for each of the legs. The difference in the voltages gives the change in resistance and can be calibrated to the physical quantities that are being measured. The Wheatstone bridge is used in many configurations such as a quarter, half, or full bridge. In the case of the quarter bridge only one resistance is unknown and the other three resistance values are matched as closely as possible to the nominal resistance value. In the case of the half bridge two resistance values are unknown and the other resistors are chosen to be as close to the nominal resistance values as possible, and in the full bridge all four resistance values are unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "When all the resistances are equal, the bridge is “balanced” and the output is $V_o$ = 0V. Due to tolerances on the electrical components it is difficult to obtain exactly 0V for the balanced bridge, however the value will be very close and this value recorded and later subtracted from the measurements. The output voltage of a Wheatstone bridge is given by, with $V_s$ the supply voltage:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_o = V_s \\frac{R_1 R_3 - R_2 R_4}{(R_2 + R_3)(R_1 + R_4)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming than the initial values of the resistances are such that the bridge is balanced, and that the value of the resistances is affected by a small amount ($R_i = R_{i,i} + \\delta R_i$, with $\\delta R_i$ the resistance variation and $R_{i,i} \\gg \\delta R_i$), at first order in $\\delta R$ and for $R_{1,i} = R_{2,i} = R_{3,i} = R_{4,i}$, the output voltage of the bridge is affected by changes in resistance in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{V_o}{V_s} = \\frac{R_{2,i} + R_{3,i}}{(R_{2,i} + R_{3,i})^2} \\left(\\frac{\\delta R_1}{R_{1,i}} - \\frac{\\delta R_2}{R_{2,i}} + \\frac{\\delta R_3}{R_{3,i}} - \\frac{\\delta R_4}{R_{4,i}}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Measure and record the resistance of each nominally 330 Ω and 20 Ω resistors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create two buses for the +5 VDC and the -5 VDC voltage supply. Again, long buses are recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select 4 pairs of resistors that, once combined, are as close as possible. Build a Wheatstone bridge with these four 350 Ω resistors. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Input ±5 VDC voltage with your power supply to the bridge ($V_s$). Monitor the output ($V_o$) with the oscilloscope. Be careful with the grounds - if your output is about half of the input, you have too many grounds and need to have either the power supply or the oscilloscope on a floating ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the DMM measure and report ($V_o = V_o^+-V_o^-$) to make sure the bridge is working properly. You will need to use the Wheatstone bridge for the rest of the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part II - Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "To do measurements on a Wheatstone bridge it is necessary to use a DAQ device with a differential input – the measured signal is $V_o = V_o^+-V_o^-$. For this, we will use the NI-9211 module (specifications in Appendix B). In addition to being able to measure thermocouple inputs, the NI-9211 module can measure differential inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the ***DAQ*** Jupyter Notebook located in the *Labs* folder and configure the `acquire` function with the additional parameters listed in *Steps 2-5*. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Set the `daq_name` to the appropriate value for the location of the *NI 9211* card (most likely `'cDAQ1Mod4'`). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Set the `mod_type` to `'tc'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set the `t_range` to have a minimum value of -0.080 and a maximum value of 0.080. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Set the sample rate to 20 Hz and the number of samples to 100. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part III - Quarter Bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment we will create a quarter and half bridge. When dealing with the different type of bridge remember to connect the strain gages on the proper branches of the bridge to obtain measurable strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clamp the cantilever beam to the edge of the work table using the C-clamp. The beam should be perpendicular to the table edge with the gage portion of the beam hanging over the edge at least two inches from the end of the table. Be careful not to damage the strain gages! The exact amount of overhang is irrelevant since the bending moment is applied between the end of the beam and the gage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measure the distance from the strain gages to the hole at the end of the beam (where weights will be hung). Do not damage the strain gages! Also measure the width and thickness of the beam in the units shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Measure the resistance of each strain gage independently to ensure that the strain gage is not damaged and record them. (If the resistance is not close to 350 Ω, consult the instructor − either you are measuring incorrectly, or there is a broken connection somewhere that will need to be re-soldered).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your Wheatstone bridge is working:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - On the circuit shown in the figure in *Part I*, replace one branch of the bridge with the strain gage attached to the top of the beam such that you have a positive output for downward deflection.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Which resistor did you replace?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Could you have replaced another resistor? Which one?\n",
    "- You are now ready to zero the bridge:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Turn on the power supply and measure the bridge output voltage both with oscilloscope and the DAQ system.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Make sure the bridge is working properly by bending the beam with your hand and noticing the voltage change on the oscilloscope.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - If the bridge output is not exactly zero record this no-load voltage with the `acquire` function. This is an offset (or bias) that you will need to subtract from the subsequent measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test that the bridge circuit is operating properly by loading the beam with a 1-kg mass. The load should cause an output voltage change. When the mass is removed, the meter reading should return to approximately the same value as before the load was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now record the measured voltage for successive loading of 0.5 kg, 1.0 kg, 1.5 kg, 2.0 kg, 2.5 kg, and 3.0 kg. Make sure you record a dataset (100 points) with the `acquire` function each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions below will be done from home except if you have time in class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In a post-processing phase, convert the voltage to strain. Explain any statistics you do to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each load calculate the expected stress in the beam:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma = \\frac{M y}{I}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $M$ is the bending moment, $y$ is the distance from the neutral axis, $I$ is the moment of inertia, $I = \\frac{bh^3}{12}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - The figure below gives the dimensions of the cantilevered beam (the units are in inches):\n",

    "\n",
    "- Plot a stress vs. strain curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do the same for the expected values (the Young's modulus of the beam is 207 GPa). \n",
