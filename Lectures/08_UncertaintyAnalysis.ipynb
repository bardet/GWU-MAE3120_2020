    "It is desired to use a Omega FMA-A2000 series mass flow meter in gas flow experiment.  The specifications for this flow meter are:\n",
    "(http://www.omega.com/pptst/FMA1600.html)\n",

    "> accuracy = 1.0 % of reading\n",
    "\n",
    "> repeatability = 0.2 % of reading\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the flow meter accuracy is too low for our application and one decides to calibrate it with a flow calibrator that has an accuracy of 0.4 % of reading.\n",
