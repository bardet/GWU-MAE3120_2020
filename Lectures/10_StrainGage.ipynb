    "Strain gages are made of thin wire that is wraped in several loops, effectively increasing the length of the wire and therefore the sensitivity of the sensor.\n",

    "Most commercially available strain gages have a nominal resistance (resistance under no load, $R_{ini}$) of 120 or 350 $\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the elastic regime, strain is typically within the range $10^{-6} - 10^{-3}$, in fact strain is expressed in unit of microstrain, with a 1 microstrain = $10^{-6}$.  Therefore, changes in resistances will be of the same order.  If one were to measure resistances, we will need a dynamic range of 120 dB, whih is typically very expensive.  Instead, one uses the Wheatstone bridge to transform the change in resistance to a voltage, which is easier to measure and does not require such a large dynamic range."

For simplicity, we will assume that the initial value of the four resistances are equal, ie $R_{1,ini} = R_{2,ini} = R_{3,ini} = R_{4,ini} = R_{ini}$.  This implies that the bridge was initially balanced, then the output voltage would be:\n",

    "Note here that the changes in $R_1$ and $R_3$ have a positive effect on $V_o$, while the changes in $R_2$ and $R_4$ have a negative effect on $V_o$.  In practice, this means that is a beam is a in tension, then a strain gage mounted on the branch 1 or 3 of the Wheatstone bridge will produce a positive voltage, while a strain gage mounted on branch 2 or 4 will produce a negative voltage.  One takes advantage of this to increase sensitivity to measure strain.\n",
